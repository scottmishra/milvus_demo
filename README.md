# milvus_demo

## Purpose

The goal of this Demo repo is to combine
- Vector Database (Milvus)
- Vectorization and Embedding creation (OpenApi GPT3/4)
- Scientific PDF parsing with (GROBID)

to build out simple scientific paper article search engine that is context aware. I'll probably be adding in some of the items from the OpenAPI cookbook
around text search and QA as I go along. The goal is to help make finding research papers and ideas easier!
